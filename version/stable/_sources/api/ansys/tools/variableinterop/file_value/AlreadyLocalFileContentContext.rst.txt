:class:`AlreadyLocalFileContentContext`
=======================================


.. py:class:: ansys.tools.variableinterop.file_value.AlreadyLocalFileContentContext(local_content_path: Optional[anyio.Path] = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`LocalFileContentContext`, :py:obj:`AsyncLocalFileContentContext`


   
   Provides a default local file context for when the file is already hosted locally.

   Because the file is already hosted and managed locally, there is no need to create a
   new copy. Therefore, this implementation basically does nothing but provide a way to
   abstract away the difference between a locally and remotely hosted file content.
