:class:`LocalFileValue`
=======================


.. py:class:: ansys.tools.variableinterop.file_value.LocalFileValue(original_path: Optional[os.PathLike] = None, mime_type: Optional[str] = None, encoding: Optional[str] = None, value_id: Optional[uuid.UUID] = None, file_size: Optional[int] = None, actual_content_file_name: Optional[os.PathLike] = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`FileValue`, :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   
   Base class for file values where the file contents already exist on the local disk.

   Generally speaking, clients of this library should not attempt to use this class. It
   is intended for dependents of this library who are attempting to implement a new
   ``FileScope`` instance that always stores the content of a file on the local disk.
   Clients are discouraged from attempting to introspect a ``FileValues``instance to
   determine if they are instances of ``LocalFileValue`` for the purpose of getting a path to the
   locally stored content. Instead, always correctly use the
   ``get_reference_to_actual_content_file`` method for the ``FileValue`` instance to
   allow the code in question to get the local path, even for files that are not
   originally hosted locally. For files that are originally hosted locally, this
   does not produce an additional copy but rather gives a context manager that does
   nothing on enter or exit but still allows access to the actual content path.

Method detail

.. py:method:: get_reference_to_actual_content_file_async(progress_callback: Optional[Callable[[int], None]] = None) -> AsyncLocalFileContentContext
   :async:


   
   Realize the file contents to a local filesystem if needed.

   The ``FileValue`` instance is intended to represent an immutable value. The file
   returned by this call may point to a cached file or even the original file. Callers
   must not modify the file on disk. Otherwise, undefined behaviors, including class 3 errors,
   may occur. If the caller needs to modify the file, consider using the ``write_file``
   method or copying the file before modifying it.

   :Parameters:

       **progress_callback** : :obj:`Optional`\[:obj:`Callable`\[[:class:`python:int`], :data:`python:None`]], :obj:`optional`
           Callback that can be called to indicate progress in realizing the local copy.
           The default is ``None``, in which case this method makes no attempt
           to report its progress. This method may call a provided callback with a
           percentage value between 0 and 100 inclusive. The provided callback may not
           necessarily be called at all, and calls for 0 or 100 percent are not guaranteed,
           even if other calls occur.



   :Returns:

       :obj:`AsyncLocalFileContentContext`
           Context manager that, when exited, deletes the local copy
           if it is a temporary file.
